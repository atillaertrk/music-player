# music-player

I'm trying to code a music player. What I've done so far:
- Playing music files from mp3 folder.
- Displaying the photo of the executed file.
- While the mp3 file is playing, the duration of the mp3 file is displayed in the progress bar.
- The volume can be adjusted.
-play, next, previous buttons are working.
-music list shows artist name/song title and total duration.

# music-player file
- Mp3 files are named in the mp3 folder, respectively, such as 1.mp3, 2.mp3...
- Jpeg files are in the img folder. For example, the image of the 1.mp3 file is 1.jpeg



I look forward to your contributions and suggestions. Thank you
